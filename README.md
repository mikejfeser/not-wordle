# not-wordle
Definitely not another Wordle clone, built for Unreal Engine 4

Originally called "Bulls and Cows", this game has you guessing a secret word by inputing letters. After entering the guess, the game will tell you which letters are in the correct place, which ones are in the word but in the wrong place, and which letters are not in the word at all. You are given a set amount of "lives" and each incorrect guess loses a life. You win by correctly guessing the word before running out of lives.
